## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JS

### What I learned

Havent done any JS before today and found it quite tricky but managed to get it to work, a lot of code in css and i know it could be shorter, will have to tidy up code going forward, will look into better naming convetions (BEM) along with perhaps SCSS/SASS along with bootstrap library? 

Responsiveness got me stuck on this mainly due to the JS pop up, have to figure out how to make that sticky / on hover on button click, hence why the css is so long.

### Continued development

Better naming convetions with (BEM) & learn more JS!
